              Earl Tucker (populary known as Snake Hips), was an American dancer who performed at the New York City Night Club called the 'Cotton Club'. Tucker is famous for the invention of dance styles, which included movements of slides and floats, which inspired and influenced similar hip-hop moves of today. Similar moves would later inspire an element of hip-hop culture known as breakdancing.
